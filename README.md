# Paint

 This is an graphics editing software where you could draw, paint, and add text in various colors.  You could create, edit, save, delete, and print images.  This project was previously published on the Microsoft Store but I decided to unpublish it as I do not wish to publish under a personal account.  You can view a demonstration of the application via this [link](https://project-videos-vs.s3.amazonaws.com/lets-paint/lets-paint-trailer.mp4).
